  ## Description
  The purpose of this project is to build a Readme Generator. It was made to create a an automated method of making a professional readme file without needing to format and write one up oneself. It solves the issue of making readme without the need of properly formatting it. Also it works as guide to building one for people who don’t have much experience making one. Making the code for it help me understand the concept of Node.js in that data can be taken and manipulated to build files from scratch and an en try point in making more complex automated software.
